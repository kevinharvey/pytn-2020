## {{ site.data.event.name }} Game Night Information

Over the past 3 years, the {{ site.data.event.short_name }} Game Night has become a staple of {{ site.data.event.short_name }}.
It's been such a hit in the past, we're bringing it back for another year.
So if you're looking for something to do with other {{ site.data.event.short_abbreviation }} attendees on Saturday evening after the conference, then look no further than the {{ site.data.event.full_abbreviation }} Game Night!

_Please note this is a ticketed event and only 100 tickets are made available._

[Meeple Mountain](https://www.meeplemountain.com/) will provide all the table top games, {{ site.data.event.short_name }} provide the food and drink, and [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/) is hosting and sponsorsing the whole thing. The only thing left is you! And in addition to providing table top games to play, Meeple Mountain will also have a few prizes to raffle off to the attendees.
In addition to providing the games, Meeple Mountain will also raffle off a number of games.
Use one of these games to start you own or add to your already-growing collection:

* Scarabya
* Junk Orbit
* Topiary
* Star Cartel
* Fireball Island The Curse of Vul Kar
* King Of Tokyo 2nd Edition
* Sagrada
* Space Base
* One Night Ultimate Werewolf

So once you've had your fill of Python for the day, come downtown and enjoy some table top games, then head out to wherever the night takes you!
