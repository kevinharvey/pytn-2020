## Talk Description
In this talk, we will describe where we've come from in terms of the problems web frameworks were tackling in the early 2000s to what the problem is now. Let's look at which languages are providing support and how they're doing it. I'll focus in and describe how Python approaches the problem. And then I'll recap with the performance graphs of multiple languages and frameworks from the Tech Empower Benchmarks.
