## Talk Description
Code review is an essential part of software quality management, and yet, the best techniques and practises for code review are often overlooked in the rush to get code deployed. This talk looks at code review as the first line of defence against defects, and gives practical suggestions for improving your review process and the quality of the software you ship. Topics discussed include improving reviewers' understanding of the code they're reviewing, choosing the right reviewers, testing the code you're reviewing, and more.
