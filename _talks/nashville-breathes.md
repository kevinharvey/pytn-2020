## Talk Description
We see the effect of climate change all around us. Nashville runs the risk of having 'bad air days' where the air quality is not so good. The impact of climate change on Nashville's air quality provides us an opportunity for innovation through collaboration. This talk shows that with a little math, we can use what we've learned while developing software to change the state of society over time. Software, policy, and data serve as the gateway for creating new technologies.
