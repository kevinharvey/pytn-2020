"Come for the language, stay for the community" is a common motto with Python.
Python's rise in the 2000s is not just because of its technical features, but also the people and community behind it.
In this keynote, Al Sweigart, author of beginner's programming book _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_, explains his path into computing, the duty to smash the barriers that block the paths of others, and how the most important aspect of technology is not the tech but the community we build around them.
