## Talk Description
Embark on an epic adventure through the twisty passageways of [a Python application developed to help Dungeon Masters run Dungeons & Dragons sessions](https://github.com/mpirnat/dndme). You’ll be joined in your quest by mighty allies such as [Prompt-Toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/), [Attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/), [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/), and [TOML](https://pypi.org/project/toml/) as you brave the perils of application structure, command completion, dynamic plugin discovery, data modeling, turn tracking, and maybe even some good old-fashioned dice rolling. Treasure and glory await!
