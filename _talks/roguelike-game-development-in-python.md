## Talk Description
Getting started with game development in Python can be challenging, even if you're already familiar with making other sorts of Python applications. It can help immensely to limit the scope of your game. To this end, we'll use the lens of [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game development to explore the whole creation process from design to publishing, including:

* choice libraries and tools for design, development and bundling
* development of an example game, including code samples demonstrating simple approaches to:
    - procedural map generation
    - collision detection
    - combat
* building standalone executables for Linux, Mac and Windows
* publishing your game online

By the end of the our time together, you will have an understanding of how to go from nothing to a complete game published to an online game marketplace.
