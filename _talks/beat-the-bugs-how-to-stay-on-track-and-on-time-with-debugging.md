## Talk Description
Don't let bugs eat your productivity! If you've ever lost a day to one, you've seen how they take your confidence and momentum too. Even the most experienced programmers can get bogged down in bug hunts.

**It doesn't have to be this way.** There are _tons_ of effective tools, tips and techniques for tracking down bugs. In this session, you'll get a truckload of them:

 * Structure your approach to (literally) save the day
 * Mine the hidden clues from errors
 * Drop your "print" statements and get X-ray vision with the right tools
 * Dig yourself out of psychological holes
 * Debug in production environments without fear
 * Exploit Murphy's Law for your own benefit
 * And, most importantly, make things easier for your future self

While this session is primarily aimed at beginner and intermediate programmers, there are tips in here that even the experts often miss.
