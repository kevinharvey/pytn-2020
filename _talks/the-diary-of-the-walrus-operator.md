## Talk Description
The Walrus operator is now a part of Python 3.8 and though heated debates are going on about it, I wanted to take a different approach to talking about it to fellow Pythonistas! 

Following the form of a personal diary, I'll share my research on the Walrus operator's life story in programming history.

Most notable milestones, influential events, and insight on its use will be a diary entry and will leave the audience more informed about the cute Walrus operator!
