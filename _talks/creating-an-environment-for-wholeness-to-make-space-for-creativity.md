## Talk Description
People are their most creative when they feel safe to bring their whole self forward.
In our agile environments, we are looking for that level of investment so that individuals can flourish and our customers can benefit from what comes forth.
How do we make space for courageous creativity in our workplaces?
What does it take to really be a place that values individuals and interactions over processes and tools?

This session will cover how we move to a mindset that fully embraces people and gives them room to explore their full potential.
We’ll discuss the fears and mental models that are holding companies back from this. Using the Relationship Bill of Rights we’ll investigate a possibility of what our day to day lives could be like.

Learning outcomes:

* Identify what Wholeness is and the parts necessary to understanding this concept
* Understand the impacts of the scarcity and abundance mindsets
* Review the Teal organization model and how it relates to Dan Pink's motivation model
* Investigate the ethics of relationships and how labels limit us
* Learn the assumptions necessary to support wholeness and ethical relationships
* Explore the Relationship Bill of Rights gaining an awareness of what might be possible
