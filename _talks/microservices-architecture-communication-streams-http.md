abstract: "No one thing in microservices architecture is complicated, however putting it all together and getting services talking in a performant, fault tolerant, and logical manner is the real trick. In this talk I'll go over both common and specialized communication patterns and illustrate how they work."

## Talk Description
In this talk we’ll go over the different parts of the microservices architecture and how each piece has to work together. I’ll go over synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns, fault tolerant data patterns, service development and (at a high level) service deployment. I’ll illustrate these concepts visually with a microservices architecture-based example game designed to show how communication occurs between different services. Some services in the example application are implemented in Python, and those will be highlighted in the session.
