## Talk Description
Of all the strange things in the galaxy, the SEP Field might be the strangest. A Somebody Else's Problem field renders something not invisible, but unnoticed. An SEP field relies on people's natural disposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain.

Where might SEP fields be in your software? Where are they in your teams? What intergalactic threat is waiting for you, out in the open but entirely ignored? 

First, don't panic. Second, make sure you have your towel. Third, forgive the speaker for her Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy jokes. Finally, confront the problems in front of you. All 42 of them.
