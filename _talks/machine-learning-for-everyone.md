Without machine learning (ML), our world would be in chaos.
Demand for ML engineers have skyrocketed, but not enough engineers to fill that demand.
However, do not worry, in Aaron's remarkable 40 minutes talk, he will talk about the paradigm of ML, and TensorFlow 2.0 along with a House Price Prediction Project!
Finally, we will finish off with a touch of magic on Reinforcement learning and tips-and-tricks from a specialist along with a special mind-blowing grand finale.
Stop taking ML as a threat and help work on the ML revolution and master the paradigm of ML today!
Let's get started.
