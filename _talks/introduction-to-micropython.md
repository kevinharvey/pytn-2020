## Talk Description

Most of us have a general idea of where our deployed code is running - either a physical server nearby, or more likely, a server farm we’ve never visited. What if there was a way to take Python to the lowest level? We expect to be able to do this easily with certain programming languages, like C/C++, but the fact that we can do it in Python is both fun and surprising - Python is known for its backend server and data processing abilities, and conveniently abstracts out much of the low-level hardware design knowledge.

Enter MicroPython, an implementation of Python 3 designed to run on microcontrollers, and the perfect tool for hobbyists and beginners looking to dig into the world of embedded systems

In this talk we’ll cover:

* The basics of working with hardware and how to select a board for your project
* The differences between MicroPython and CPython
* How to detect angle, motion and touch on a pyboard
* Helpful libraries for creating graphics on a pyboard
