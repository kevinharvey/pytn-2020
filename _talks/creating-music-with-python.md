abstract: "Have you ever thought about converting code into music and making some really awesome beats? You can do that with jythonMusic! jythonMusic uses Python but it has functionalities like Java. You can create all types of musical genres with this technology and I can show you how to do it through a demo."

## Talk Description
Jython is an open source implementation of the Python programming language, integrated with the Java platform. JythonMusic is an open source environment for music making and creative programming activities. It is intended for musicians and programmers of all levels and backgrounds. It provides libraries for music making, image manipulation, building graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and for connecting to external MIDI and OSC devices. JythonMusic supports music transcription and playback, audio looping, computer-aided music composition, development of computer-based musical instruments (including hybrid instruments), and live performance. With this demonstration, I plan to turn my computer into a musical instrument using Python. I will play music made by Beethoven, Deep Purple, Tupac Shakur, Mozart, and Deep Purple. I will also experiment with the Python GUI library. A GUI is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.
