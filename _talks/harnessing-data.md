about: >
    After working as an engineer and in the academic laboratory setting for a decade, Lindsey started her data science career in 2015 at a healthcare startup and worked for 4.5 years to build a data science team of 5 alongside a vibrant data science internship program.
    During that time, she became very active in Nashville's data science community.
    Her involvement locally in Nashville includes both participating in and leading meetups, serving on technical and career panels, local conferences, mock interviews and other educational events for students and trainees, and mentorship.
    In January 2020, Lindsey joined Healthcare Bluebook as a Senior Data Scientist and is devoted to using data science and analytics to help consumers navigate healthcare pricing to make more informed healthcare choices while driving metrics-based business value.
    When not at Bluebook or at a local professional event, Lindsey can be found grilling steak, spending time with her 2 rescue pugs, biking, jogging, or playing golf.
